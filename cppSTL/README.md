Priority Queue :-Priority queues are a type of container adapters, specifically designed such that the first element of the queue is the greatest of all elements in the queue and elements are in decreasing order.<br><br>
Deque :- Double ended queues are sequence containers with the feature of expansion and contraction on both the ends.
They are similar to vectors, but are more efficient in case of insertion and deletion of elements. Unlike vectors, contiguous storage allocation may not be guaranteed.<br><br>
If you want to add some more decent properties to it.Please fork I will accept pull request ;).
